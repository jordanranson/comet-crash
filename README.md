# Comet Crash

This is my submission for KilledByAPixel's 2KPlusJam 2020 (https://itch.io/jam/2kplus-jam).
This game is written in Lua for PICO-8. The code is minified using a NodeJS script of my own design, and then zipped using Keka for macOS. The zipped, minified source files should be no larger than 2048 bytes.


## Instructions

Guide a floating comet through space while trying to destroy enemy comets.
Grab the pink power ups to blast your enemies to pieces.
How many waves can you survive?

- Title and instruction screen
- Sound effects and music
- Adjusted timings and particle counts to match the music and sound
